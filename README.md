# Twitter_Sentimental_Analysis
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to analyze tweets and categorize them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
